My custom yasnippet snippets.
Don't know how much awesomeness there is there, probably too complex as usual. Anyway, you need to know that I make use of a lot of placeholders containing smaller placeholders, wherever there's something optional: the idea is, if you don't need the optional things (for instance the optional arguments to autoload) you just hit C-d to remove (in this case) both of them, otherwise you tab again to get "inside" the group and edit the first one -- in this case, presumably, to specify 'interactive.
