My custom yasnippet snippets.

Don't know how much awesomeness there is there, probably too complex as usual. Anyway, you need to know that I make use of a lot of placeholders containing smaller placeholders, wherever there's something optional: the idea is, if you don't need the optional things (for instance the optional arguments to `autoload`) you just hit `C-d` to remove (in this case) both of them, otherwise you tab again to get "inside" the group and edit the first one -- in this case, presumably, to specify `'interactive`.

Oh, yes, I use C-style outdenting. That's right: closing parens on their own lines. Block structuring, visually represented. The AST, visually represented. Sexp nesting, visually represented. The right way. Because I have a great big portrait display. Get over it. Better still, get with it. Join us on the sunlit uplands of enlightenment. Those "historical reasons" for "the Lisp way"? They aren't reasons at all. They're mindless habit, they're unthinking convention, they're brute conformity raised to the level of principle, and they're butt-aching stupid. And they make Lisp even more impenetrable and unapproachable than it needs to be for non-Lispers.
